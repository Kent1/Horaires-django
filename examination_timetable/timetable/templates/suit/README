After installed django and djang-suit, you need to use the two templates in
the current directory to have the correct display: base.html and menu.html.

base.html must be copied in the suit directory at the position
[...]/suit/admin/base.html and replace the current one.

menu.html must be copied in the suit directory at the position
[...]/suit/suit/menu.html and replace the current one.

Then, the design of the django admin display is correctly setted.
